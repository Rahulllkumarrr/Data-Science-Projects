Task 1 – Bike journey data exploratory data analysis

• Load the metro.csv file into a pandas data frame.
• Find a sensible way to remove the missing values from the data frame, and
explain why you have chosen this method.
• Explore the distribution of the duration variable. You should produce a
plot visualising the distribution, and calculate and discuss briefly statistics
of the variable.
• Produce a plot showing how the distribution of duration relates to passholder
type.
• Perform an appropriate statistical test to check if the mean duration
is different between One Day Pass and Flex Pass passholders. What
assumptions have you made by using this test?
• Convert the start_time and end_time columns to date objects if they are
not already.
• Create a new column in the data frame that gives the hour of the day that
each journey started on.
• Explore how the duration variable varies between each journey starting
hour of the day, creating a plot to visualise this.
• Explore how the distribution of the duration variable varies between each
day of the week, creating a plot to visualise this.
• Calculate the total numbers of passholders of each type travelling on each
week day. Discuss the results.

Task 2 – Seed shape data
• Load the seeds.csv file into a pandas data frame.
• Explore the data, and find a way to cluster the seeds, assigning a cluster to
each. Visualise the results, and explain why you have applied the method
you have used.


Task 3 – Social network analysis
Using networkx, load the social network data in the social-network.csv file.
• Produce a visualisation of the network and discuss the output.
• Calculate statistics of the network, plot them where relevant, and discuss
the results, explaining the meaning of any statistics you have calculated.
You can use networkx to calculate statistics of the network, rather than implementing
your own Python code to do so. The visualisation may be hard to
interpret at first, experimenting with di
